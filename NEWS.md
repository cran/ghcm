Package: ghcm
==========================

Version: 2.0.0 [2021-09-27]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

  * The major functionality of the package has been restricted to functions observed on an equidistant grid, however, the methodology underneath has also been vastly improved and simplified resulting in a different API for the main ghcm_test function.
